# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about *me*:

1. I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science with major in Computer Science
2. I am taking **STATS 220** because it will provide me with practical skills to solve data analysis problems and work effectively with data
3. I am interested in learning how to solve data-analytical problems and apply creative thinking with data technologies
