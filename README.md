# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science with major in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because it will provide me with practical skills to solve data analysis problems and work effectively with data 
- I am interested in learning how to solve data-analytical problems and apply creative thinking with data technologies
